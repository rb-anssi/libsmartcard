About the smartcard library API
-------------------------------

The API exposed by the library is quite simple and mainly exposes:

  * Initialization functions to configure a smart card connection
  * Primitives to send APDUs (and get back a response)
  * Primitives for pretty printing
  * Primitives for detecting card insertion

.. note::
  If these APIs are very similar to the ones exposed by the ISO7816 library this
  is not a coincidence since they are mainly wrappers to them

Card abstraction
""""""""""""""""

A card is abstracted with the following structure: ::

  typedef union {
        SC_ATR atr;
        SC_NFC nfc;
  } SC_Info;
  typedef struct {
        /* Card type (contact or contactless) */
        smartcard_types type;
        /* Card information (ATR for contact cards, ATQ/ATS for contacless, ... */
        SC_Info info;
        /* the protocol we use */
        uint8_t T_protocol;
  } SC_Card;

As we can see, this captures the abstraction layer above contact and contacless cards.

Initialization functions
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The initialization functions are the following: ::

  int SC_fsm_early_init(sc_map_mode_t map_mode);
  int SC_fsm_init(SC_Card *card, uint8_t do_negotiate_pts, uint8_t do_change_baudrate, uint8_t do_force_protocol, uint32_t do_force_etu);

The 'SC_fsm_early_init' simply initializes the lower levels (it is a mere call to the low level ISO7816
library and driver that initializes the necessary hardware IPs such as USART and GPIOs).

The 'SC_fsm_init' function is the core function that establishes the contact with the smart card. Its purpose is to get the ATR for
contact cards, the ATQ for contacless cards, and optionally negotiate the PSS (when possible). The arguments are the following:

  * SC_Card \*card: the structure that will receive the card abstract representation

The following arguments have a signification only for contact cards for now (contacless cards support is a work
in progress):


  * uint8_t do_force_protocol: does the user want to force the protocol. A value of 0 means no protocol is forced,
  a value of 1 means T=0 is forced, a value of 2 means T=1 is forced
  * uint8_t do_negotiate_pts: effectively performs the PTS protocol negotiation if set to non zero
  * uint8_t do_change_baudrate: effectively modifies the baudrate with the card if set to non zero
  * uint32_t do_force_etu: forces a target ETU if set to non zero. If the provided ETU is not achievable,
  we use a 'best fit' algorithm to get the closest ETU lower than the one asked by the user

This function returns 0 on success, and non zero on error.

.. note::
  The following elements mainly concern contact cards. Contacless cards are work in progress 

A default usage of 'SC_fsm_init' is: ::

  SC_Card card;
  if(SC_fsm_init(&card, 0, 0, 0, 0)){
    goto err;
  }

This initialization establishes a communication channel with the smart card if present, or waits its presence if not,
and does not negotiate anything. The ETU stays at the default value of 372 ETU (default value as defined by the standard)
and the protocol is the preferred one provided by the card ATR (or T=0 as standardized default if no preferred protocol is given).

A more advanced usage can be: ::

  SC_Card card;
  if(SC_fsm_init(&card, 1, 1, 2, 64)){
    goto err;
  }

This call asks for a PSS negotiation, asks for a baud rate change, forces the T=1 protocol and asks for a 64 ETU value.

The user can also perform a negotiation attempt and then fallback to default: ::

  SC_Card card;
  if(SC_fsm_init(&card, 1, 1, 2, 64)){
    if(SC_fsm_init(&card, 0, 0, 0, 0)){
      goto err;
    }
  }

.. note::
  Forcing elements such as the protocol or the ETU heavily depends on the smart card: some values and/or some smart cards
  are not compatible or supported. This is why it is recommended to fallback to a non negotitated 'SC_fsm_init'
  if the negotiated one fails
 

Primitives to send APDUs
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

The library provides a unique API to send an APDU to a smart card and receive its response: ::

  int SC_send_APDU(SC_APDU_cmd *apdu, SC_APDU_resp *resp, SC_Card *card);

The 'apdu' argument is a pointer to an input APDU structure, the 'resp' response is a pointer to a
response structure that will be filled by the function, the 'card' structure is a pointer to an
abstract card that has been obtained in the initialization phase with 'SC_fsm_init'.
The library automatically handles the physical layer (T=0 or T=1, ISO14443) depending on the initialization
phase.

The APDU structure is the following: ::

  /* An APDU command (handling extended APDU) */
  typedef struct
  {
        uint8_t cla;  /* Command class */
        uint8_t ins;  /* Instruction */
        uint8_t p1;   /* Parameter 1 */
        uint8_t p2;   /* Parameter 2 */
        uint16_t lc;  /* Length of data field, Lc encoded on 16 bits since it is always < 65535 */
        uint8_t data[APDU_MAX_BUFF_LEN];  /* Data field */
        uint32_t le;   /* Expected return length, encoded on 32 bits since it is <= 65536 (so we must encode the last value) */
        uint8_t send_le;
  } SC_APDU_cmd;

The response has the following structure: ::

  /* An APDU response */
  typedef struct
  {
        uint8_t data[APDU_MAX_BUFF_LEN + 2]; /* Data field + 2 bytes for temporaty SW1/SW2 storage */
        uint32_t le; /* Actual return length. It is on an uint32_t because we increment it when receiving (this avoids integer overflows). */
        uint8_t sw1; /* Status Word 1 */
        uint8_t sw2; /* Status Word 2 */
  } SC_APDU_resp;


Sending an APDU and getting back a response is as simple as: ::
  
  /* Initialize a communication with the card */
  SC_Card card;
  if(SC_fsm_init(&card, 1, 1, 2, 64)){
    goto err;
  }
  /* Prepare our APDU and response */
  SC_APDU_cmd apdu;
  SC_APDU_resp resp;
  /* Fill in the APDU we want to send:
   * In this case, we send CLA=00 INS=01 P1=00 P2=00 DATA="000102" (Lc=3) and Le=00
   */
  apdu.cla = 0x00; apdu.ins = 0x01; apdu.p1 = apdu.p2 = 0x00;
  apdu.lc = 3; apdu.data[0] = 0x00; apdu.data[1] = 0x01; apdu.data[2] = 0x02;
  apdu.le = 0x00; apdu.send_le = 1;
  /* Send the APDU and get the response */
  if(SC_send_APDU(&apdu, &resp, &card)){
    goto err;
  }
  /* If there is no error, resp is filled with the card response! */

Pretty printing
""""""""""""""""

We have straightforward APIs for pretty printing on the debug console the abstract card, APDUs and responses: ::
  
  void SC_print_Card(SC_Card *card);
  void SC_print_APDU(SC_APDU_cmd *apdu);
  void SC_print_RESP(SC_APDU_resp *resp);
  

Card insertion detection
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
The following API: ::

  uint8_t SC_is_smartcard_inserted(SC_Card *card);

can be used for polling the smart card presence (returns 0 is card is absent, non zero otherwise).

For asynchronous detection, a callback registration mechanism is also offered through: ::

  int SC_register_user_handler_action(SC_Card *card, void (*action)(void));
